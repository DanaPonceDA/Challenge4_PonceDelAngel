Tattler is a Mexican restaurant directory that has been transformed into an interactive and personalized application. The platform allows users to find restaurants based on up-to-date data and personal preferences, improving user experience and engagement. 

The project uses MongoDB for managing restaurant data and Express.js to build a REST API, enabling users to:

- Add comments and ratings for restaurants
