Tattler RESTful API is a backend project developed as part of Challenge 4, two professionals at a Mexican company seeking to revitalize a nationwide restaurant directory.

They decide to redesign Tattler into a dynamic and intelligent platform that provides personalized culinary experiences.
They use MongoDB for storing restaurant data and Express.js to create a REST API that enables CRUD operations and real-time interaction with the directory.

This project implements:

 Mongoose models for structured restaurant data.
Express routes for managing restaurants, grades, and comments.
Controllers with validation and error handling.
 Clear documentation and versioning guidelines (Major.Minor.Revision)

 Before starting, ensure that you have installed:

Node.js (v18 or higher)
MongoDB (local or Atlas)
npm or yarn
